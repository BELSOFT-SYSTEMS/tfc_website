                The Marriage Course is for couples who are seeking to strengthen their relationship. Some couples do the course to intentionally invest in their relationship, others are looking to address more specific challenges. Either way, the course offers essential tools and  practical ideas to help you build a relationship that lasts a lifetime.

                <p> <strong style={{fontWeight:'bolder'}}>Time to Connect</strong><br/>
                Each session begins with couples having a time to connect with refreshments and snacks. This  gives guests a chance to unwind and connect before the sessionâ€™s episode. It also helps to create  the atmosphere of a date.

                <p> <strong style={{fontWeight:'bolder'}}>Watch episode</strong><br/>
                The episodes are around 45 minutes in length, with breaks for conversations. Each episode  explores a different topic through real experiences, expert insights, and relevant teaching.
                </p>
                <p> <strong style={{fontWeight:'bolder'}}>Talk privately</strong><br/>
                Providing space for couples to have private, intimate conversations is a must for every course. It  helps enable couples to engage openly and honestly throughout the session.
